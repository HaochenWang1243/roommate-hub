## Context and Problem Statement

- How to handle styling?

## Decision

- Use Bootstrap for the styling, replacing most of the temporary styling that's currently being used for the pages.
- For efficiency's sake, don't completely overwrite styling that's already in place if it looks good. A mix between CSS and Bootstrap is okay.

## Pros Considered

- Bootstrap is simple and easy to use compared to plain CSS.
- Some team members already have experience with Bootstrap.
- We will be able to have a professional, consistent header and footer for every page.
