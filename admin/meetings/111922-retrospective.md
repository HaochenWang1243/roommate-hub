### **Retrospective Notes**

<ol>
    <li>Choice of Modular Team Operation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Originally we were planning on having one large team, and assigning roles and duties on a larger scale. This included meetings with all participants and required extensive time on issue assigning where those who had no relation would need to spend time hearing the discussion of back end issues for example.
            The problem with this method revolved around the unnecessary need for all members to know the fine details of issues not related to them.</li>
            <li>Instead we moved to a system where members were assigned to three groups: backend, frontend, devops. Each have their own slack channel and agendas to operate under, and spearheaded by a specific team lead.
            In this fashion, it boosted communication and interaction as smaller teams seemed more promotive of discussion about issues and features. Furthermore when there needed to be interactions between teams, both parties were more well versed in their individual agendas, so the cohesion between ideas worked out more smoothly</li>
        </ul>
    <li>People centered approach vs feature centered approach </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Originally in our  SUM meetings we began only looking at issues and features and made that our focus. Rather than see where an individual might want to focus on we were to fixated on whether a ticket was closed or not</li>
            <li>We now operate our SUMs asking each individual about how the week went for them in respect to the project. Where were the bottle necks and accomplishments. In this we found that our group mates communicated more about the issues they were facing, and boosted interaction between everyone as it showcases that everyone had issues and struggles.</li>
        </ul>
</ol>
