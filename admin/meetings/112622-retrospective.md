### **Retrospective Notes**

1. Originally we were thinking of testing with e2e strictly, but we found a lot of benefit in creating local unit tests specifically for the
   API functions, to see how they work isolated.
   Furtermore the pipeline was not going to contain the e2e tests but we decided it was important to see if the user workflow would still work with new code.
2. We decided to generally take a simplistic approach to features instead of overcomplicating it for users.
   We want our product to not cause confusion, this directly affected how we changed the bill divider to a money balancer, which had a more straightforward fuunctionoality of balancing money owed between all roommates.
3. Finally styling, we were thinking of having everyone style their page in their own way.
   Every owner of a feature would style in their own scope.
   This led to too much variance in the look of the application, instead we had two people take care of all styling so we could achieve a unified look.
