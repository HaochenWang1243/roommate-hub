  - Traffic tracking API
    - An API to show traffic on the road in a given area.
  - Movie graph
    - A sort of social media for movies that will display connections between a user's favorite films and others'.
  - Mathematical model
    - More of a concept to do something mathematical than a fleshed out idea.
  - Voting game
    - A game where different users would vote on some question(s). Something in the style of Kahoot or Jackbox, but users would be polled for subjective answers instead of quizzed on objective answers.
- Agreed to vote on 3 ideas over Slack by 10/20 at 3:00 PM.
