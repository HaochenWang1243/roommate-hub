## Team Values

As a group, we discussed what our team values are and based on keywords, came up with some value rules:

1. **Communicate** with your Teammates
2. Be **empathetic** toward your teammates
3. Be **flexible** with meeting times but still attend them
4. Resolve conflicts **respectfully**
5. Be **understanding** of group members
